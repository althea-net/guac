Question Thread

1) replace string values with randomly generated encrypted key?

2) 'updateState not ended but settled' does not fail...

3) Holdoff period is measured in blocks rather than time? 

4) TestRPC throwing runtime error "invalid opcode" message, shows several blocks were skipped over... possibly related to snapshot revert?

5)  setting sequencenumber in contract to 10 causes 'updateState low seq #' to fail, whereas 0 causes it to pass... shouldnt it be the otherway around?
